    <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>A problem that I face on a day to day basis is spenting to much unnesessery time on my phone. I feel like i'm always 
            spending time at the wrong time "doom scrolling". This is a problem because when im trying to do something productive
            I get caught up on my phone instead of doing a productive task. I know this is a problem because everyone that I talk
            to about it they know exactly what i'm talking about. 
        </p>

    <h2>Problem Solution</h2>
    <p>The way i'm thinking about solving this problem is make an app that when you downloaded it asks to have promision for all your apps
        that are "Scoial Media" apps and shows how long do you want to shut off these apps for and whatever time they select. All the Social Media
        apps will be shut off for that period of time. The only way to unlock it is solving a really hard problem.
