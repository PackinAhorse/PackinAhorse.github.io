    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My mission is to be honest and hardworking in everything I do. 
    I want to always push myself to be the best version of me while staying true to my values. I love 
    to work with others and I don’t shy away from criticism because it helps me grow and become a better 
    person. I care about teamwork, freedom, math, and connecting with people. I want to use these passions 
    to make a difference by staying resilient and persistent no matter what challenges come my way throughout 
    life.</p>

  <div class="Problem">
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>A problem that I face on a day to day basis is spending too much unnecessary time on my phone. I feel like I'm always 
    spending time at the wrong time "doom scrolling"...</p>

    <h2>Problem Solution</h2>
    <p>The way I'm thinking about solving this problem is to make an app that asks permission for all your social media apps
    and locks them for a chosen time period, unless you solve a hard problem to unlock early.</p>

    <h2>My Assignment Code</h2>
    <div class="assignment">
      <p>Shape Tree</p>
      <p>Homework 06</p>
      <p>Objective:</p>
      <p>Write a program where a user can maintain a collection of shapes that are organized by their area using a binary search 
        tree data structure. The program must be able to add/remove shapes, read/write to shape files, search for shapes, and perform 
        a variety of other operations.</p>

    <p>Homework 07</p>
    <p>Sheep Shearing Scheduler</p>
    <p>Objective:</p> 
    <p>Write a program which will generate a sheep shearing schedule based on a given file and priority scheduling. 
      Only one sheep can be sheared at a time and the other sheep must wait to be sheared. While the other sheep are waiting, 
      they are prioritized by smaller shearing times and then by their name in alphabetical order. The next sheep to be sheared 
      has the highest priority.</p>

    <p>Food Order Scheduler</p>
    <p>Objective:</p>
    <p>During a busy lunch, a chef must cook orders while minimizing the average waiting time per customer. Unfortunately, 
      the chef only can cook the orders one at a time. Using a min-heap, schedule food orders based on their shortest cooking 
      times in order to get the best average waiting times.</p>
