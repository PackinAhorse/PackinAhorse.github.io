    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My mission is to be honest and hardworking in everything I do. 
    I want to always push myself to be the best version of me while staying true to my values. I love 
    to work with others and I don’t shy away from criticism because it helps me grow and become a better 
    person. I care about teamwork, freedom, math, and connecting with people. I want to use these passions 
    to make a difference by staying resilient and persistent no matter what challenges come my way throughout 
    life.</p>

  <div class="Problem">
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>A problem that I face on a day to day basis is spending too much unnecessary time on my phone. I feel like I'm always 
    spending time at the wrong time "doom scrolling"...</p>

    <h2>Problem Solution</h2>
    <p>The way I'm thinking about solving this problem is to make an app that asks permission for all your social media apps
    and locks them for a chosen time period, unless you solve a hard problem to unlock early.</p>
