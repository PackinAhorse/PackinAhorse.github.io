    life.</p>

    <div class="assignment">
      <p>Shape Tree</p>
      <p>Homework 06</p>
      <p>Objective:</p>
      <p>Write a program where a user can maintain a collection of shapes that are organized by their area using a binary search 
        tree data structure. The program must be able to add/remove shapes, read/write to shape files, search for shapes, and perform 
        a variety of other operations.</p>

    <p>Sheep Shearing Scheduler</p>
    <p>Objective:</p> 
    <p>Write a program which will generate a sheep shearing schedule based on a given file and priority scheduling. 
      Only one sheep can be sheared at a time and the other sheep must wait to be sheared. While the other sheep are waiting, 
      they are prioritized by smaller shearing times and then by their name in alphabetical order. The next sheep to be sheared 
      has the highest priority.</p>

    <p>Food Order Scheduler</p>
    <p>Objective:</p>
    <p>During a busy lunch, a chef must cook orders while minimizing the average waiting time per customer. Unfortunately, 
      the chef only can cook the orders one at a time. Using a min-heap, schedule food orders based on their shortest cooking 
      times in order to get the best average waiting times.</p>
