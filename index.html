    <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>A problem that I face on a day to day basis is spending too much unnecessary time on my phone. I feel like I'm always 
            spending time at the wrong time "doom scrolling". This is a problem because when im trying to do something productive
            I get caught up on my phone instead of doing a productive task. I know this isn’t just a problem for me because everyone
            that I talk to talks about it.
        </p>

    <h2>Problem Solution</h2>
    <p>The way i'm thinking about solving this problem is make an app that when you downloaded it asks to have permission for all your apps
        that are "Social Media" apps and show how long you want to shut off these apps for and whatever time they select. All the Social Media
        apps will be shut off for that period of time. The only way to unlock it is solving a really hard problem.
